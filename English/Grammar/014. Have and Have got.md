# Have and have got

**Have** and **have got** (= for possession, relationships, illnesses etc.)

You can use **have** or **have got**. There's is no difference in meaning:

- They **have** a new car. *or* They **have got** a new car.
- Lisa **has** two brothers. *or* Lisa's **got** two brothers.
- I **have** a headache *or* I've **got** a headache.

With these meanings (possession etc.), you cannot use continuous forms (**am having** etc.):

- We're enjoying our holiday. We **have** / **We've got** a nice room in the hotel, (**not** We're
having a nice room)

For the past we use **had** (without got):

- Lisa **had** long hair when she was a child. (*not* Lisa had got)

In questions and negative sentences there are three possible forms:

| Questions | Negative |
| --------- | -------- |
| **Do you have** any questions? | I **don't have** any questions |
| **Have you got** any questsion? | I **haven't got** any questions |
| **Have you** any questsion? (less usual) | I **haven't** any questions |

In past questions and negative sentences we use **did/didn't**:

- **Did** you **have** a car when you were living in Paris?
- I **didn't** have my phone, so I couldn't call you.
- Lisa **had** long hair, **didn't** she?

**Have breakfast / have a shower / have a good time** etc.

We also use **have** (but not have got) for many actions and experiences. For example:

```
have + breakfast / dinner / a cup of coffee / something to eat etc.

have + a bath / a shower / a swim / a break / a rest / a party / a holiday
an accident / an experience / a dream

have + a look (at something)

have + a chat / a conversation / a disscusstion (with somebody)

trouble / difficulty / fun / a good game (with somebody)

a baby (give birth to a baby)
```

**Have got** is not possible in the expressions in the box. Compare:

- Sometimes I **have** (= *eat*) a sandwich for my lunch, (not I've got)

*but*

- **I've got / I have** some sandwiches. Would you like one?

You can use continuous forms (am having etc.) with the expressions in the box:

- We're enjoying our holiday. **We're having** a great time, (not We have)
- Mark **is having** a shower at the moment. He has a shower every day.

In questions and negative sentences we use **do/does/did**:
