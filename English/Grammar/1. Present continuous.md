# Present continuous

Sarah is in her car. She is on her way to work.
She is driving to work.

This means: she is driving now, at the time of speaking.
**The action is not finished.**

**Am/Is/Are + V-ing** is the *present continuous*:

|S|V|
|:---|:---|
| I **am**     | driving |
| He/She/It is | working |
| We/You/They are | doing etc. |

**I am doing something** = I'm in the middle of doing it; I've started doing it and I haven't finished

You can use the present continuous with **today / this week / this year etc.** (periods around now):

```
A : You're working hard today. (not You work hard today)
B: Yes, I have a lot to do. The company I work for isn't doing so well this year.
```

We use the present continuous when we talk about changes happening around now, especially
v.a with these verbs:

`get`, `change`, `become`, `increase`, `rise`, `fall`, `grow`, `improve`, `begin`, `start`
