# Past continous

Yesterday Karen and Jim played tennis. They started at
10 o'clock and finished at 11.30.

So, at 10.30 they **were playing** tennis.

They **were playing** = they were in the middle of playing.
They had not finished playing.
**Was/were V-ing** is the *past continuous*:

- I/he/she/it + **was V-ing**
- You/we/they + **were V-ing**

---
I **was doing something** = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or
situation had already started before this time, but had not finished:

(**I started doing**) ----- (**I was doing**) ----- (**I finished doing**) -------------------->

------- *Past* ----------------- *Past* ----------------------------------------- *Now* ---->

---
Compare the past con tinuous (I was doing) and past simple (I did):

| *Past continuous* (in the middle of action) | *Past simple* (complete action) |
| --- | --- |
| I **was walking** home when I met Dan (in the middle of walking home) | I **walked** home after the party last night (=all the way, completely) |

We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the
middle of something else:

- Matt **phoned** while we **were having** dinner.
- It **was raining** when I **got up**

But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened after another:

- I **was walking** along the road when I **saw** Dan. So I **stopped**, and we **had** a chat

Compare:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| When Karen arrived, we **were having** dinner. (= we had already started before she arrived) | When Karen arrived, we **had** dinner. (= Karen arrived, and then we haddinner) |

Some verbs (for example, **know** and **want**) are not normally used in the continuous:

- We were good friends. We **knew** each other well. (not We were knowing)
- I was enjoying the party, but Chris **wanted** to go home. (not was wanting)
