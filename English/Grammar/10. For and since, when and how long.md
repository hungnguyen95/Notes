# For and since, When and How long

## For and since

We use **for** + a period of time (**two hours, six
weeks** etc.)

- Sally has been working here for **six
months.**
- I haven't seen Tom **for three days**.

We use **since** + the start of a period
(8 o'clock, Monday, 1999 etc.):

- Sally has been working here **since April**.
- I haven't seen Tom **since Monday**.

---

We do not use **for + all** ... (**all day / all my life** etc.):

- I've lived here **all my life** (not for all my life)

You can use in instead of for in negative sentences (**I haven't**... etc.):

- **They haven't** had a holiday **in ten years**. (= for ten years)

## When and How long

When (Past simple) and How long (present perfect)

*When:*

` When did it start raining?`

`It started raining an hour ago / at 1 o'clock`

*How long:*

`How long has it been raining?`

`It's been raining for an hour / since 1 o'clock.`

We say:

- **It's** (It is) + `a long time / six months / etc...` since something happened.
- **It's been** (It has been) + `a long time / six months / etc...` since something happened.

Example:

- **How long is it since** Mrs Hill died? *or* **How long has it been since** .
